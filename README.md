# 189-Machine-Learning-Models
This repository contains my completed assignments for CS189: Machine Learning. Each assignment focuses on a different ML model/technique(eg: SVM, LDA/QDA, Neural Network), and contains both a math section where I derive important results and a coding section where I code these models from scratch. ***None of the models come from popular libraries*** 


**** I'm not allowed to disclose my solutions publicly, however for employer requests, please email me @ dhruv_ahuja@berkeley.edu***
